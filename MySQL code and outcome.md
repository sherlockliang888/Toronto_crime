# MySQL Code and Outcome
After splitting the data and constructing five new tables, I have successfully created a Toronto Crime Database from 2014 to 2019. Now in this file, I will be exploring 
the database with DBMS MySQL and answering some questions that I have come up with. A small portion of outcome to each question will attached as screenshots from MySQL Workbench. 

#### 1. How many unique events are there in total?
#### 3. Which neighbourhood and division have the highest average events per year? 
#### 4. What's the address for each police division and what neighbourhoods are under their supervision? 
#### 5. How many events have different occurrence and report dates? 
#### 6. Which division encountered the most cases on average per year on Christmas Day?
