# MySQL Code and Outcome
After splitting the data and constructing five new tables, I have successfully created a Toronto Crime Database from 2014 to 2019. Now in this file, I will be exploring 
the database with DBMS MySQL and answering some questions that I have come up with. A small portion of outcome to each question will attached as screenshots from MySQL Workbench.
